  ## Description
  This is a repository that stores and hosts code for a social network app's backend api structure. The purpose is to provide the underlying functionality using MongoDB as a database, integrating it with NodeJS through Mongoose. The api routes and controller functionality were separate in this project, which was a break from previous work, where the routes and functions were in the same file. It made for an interesting logistical challenge initially, but the separation is much cleaner and easier to follow, especially for someone not intimately familiar with the code.

  ## Installation
  Installation details for this project were essentially twofold. Mongoose was required for the database structure, and express was used for routing apis. Additionally, MongoDB was also installed on my local system.

  ## Usage
  Open the source code in an integrated terminal. Run the <npm i> command to install aforementioned requirements. Next, run <npm start> command to establish a connection to the local host. Following these steps, tesing routes is possible using Insomnia, as demonstrated in the video link.
